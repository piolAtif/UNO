UNO basic:
 The object
 		Empty your cards from the deck.

 The board
 	* Game begins with 108 cards. In which every player has 7 cards initially.

 	* There are basically four color : red,green,blue,yellow.

 	* There are five special cards : wild cards,wild draw four cards,skip cards,reverse cards,draw two cards.

 	* Each color cards have : 0 to 9 and skip cards,reverse cards,draw two cards,skip cards.

How to play:

	1) Deal 7 cards per player; create a Draw pile with remaining cards: Shuffle the deck and deal seven cards, face down, to each player. Stack the remaining cards face down to form a Draw pile.

	2) Turn up first card in Draw pile: Turn over the first card in the Draw pile to create a Discard pile.

	3)  Have the person to your left match the Discard card: Have the person to the dealer’s left match some aspect of the Discard pile card — either the number, color, or symbol. Place this card face up on top of the Discard pile.

	4) Draw from the Draw pile if no match is made: Draw one card from the top of the Draw pile if no match can be made with the card on the Discard pile. The drawn card can be played if it matches the Discard pile card.

	5) Pass to next player: Pass the play to the next player after a match is made or a card is drawn from the Draw pile. Continue counterclockwise, matching the number, color, or symbol with the Discard pile or drawing from the Draw pile.

	6) Shout "Uno!" when you have one card left: Shout “Uno!” when you only have one card remaining in your hand. Play until one person is out of cards.

	7) Add values of cards in opponents' hands for the score: Add the values of the cards remaining in everyone else’s hands, with number cards counting as face value; Draw Two, Reverse, and Skip cards counting for 20 points; and Wild Cards counting for 50 points.

	8) Continue playing until someone's cards become empty.

	
Hints and tips:

	*	1st tip: pay close attention because a lot of the time people aren't focusing on what they're doing.

	*	2nd tip: Try to get rid of numbers that match up in your hand. For example if you have a red 5 and a yellow 5, try 		to get rid of one of the fives. It will help you have more number choices instead of repetatives.

	*	3rd tip: Try to keep your wild card as long as you can! I have seen so many people use their wild card early on in 		the game and they just end up losing. It is a good idea to save it for the last card. For example if you have a 		wild card and a red 5 left, use your wild card and change the color to red, hoping that no one changes it by the 		time it comes back to you. I suggest if you have both a draw 4 wild card and a regular wild card, use the regular 		one first. You know that if you put down a draw 4 card, the player after you loses a turn and draws 4, so that's 		one step closer to making sure you get the color you need. The only time I suggest you use your wild card before 		last is if you are badly losing while everyone else is winning.

	*	4th tip: If the player before you puts down a wild card (a regular one) and they've only got one left, don't put a 		reverse card down, that's just giving that player an automatic win, and I've seen someone do that before. If that't 	the only card you have, draw a card or pass, so that the chances of them wining will be reduced because hopefully 		another player can change the color before they win.

	*	5th tip: Similar to the 4th, but if the player after you used a wild card and now only has one card left and the 		color hasn't been changed, try to change it by drawing a card hoping you can put a different color down with the 		same number or whatever. If you have no choice than just pass or play what you have. But at least you took the 			extra step by doing what you can to prevent them from winning. 

	*	6th tip: If you have a deck of the same color cards, or mostly the same color, play the ones that prevent the next 		player from having a turn first. For example if you have a deck of mostly yellow cards and maybe 3 are numbers, one 	is a skip card, one is a draw 2 card or whatever, play the skip or draw 2 cards first. You're increasing your 			chances of the color staying the same by the time it gets back to you.

	*	7th tip: Don't forget to say Uno! So many people forget and it just causes you to draw 2 cards and reduces your 		chances of winning, so keep that in mind. 

	*	8th tip: I may have already said this but if you have both a draw 4 wild card and a regular wild card, use your 		regular one first because with your draw 4 one, you're taking a turn away from the next player, and may help 			increase your chances of the same color coming back to you. With the regular wild card you're changing the color 		but the next player may for example put down the color you chose and the one after may put down the same number but 	change the color. So automatically your plan is ruined.

	*	9th tip: If you don't really have any good cards, but mostly just number cards of similar colors, just try to use 		the ones of similiar colors first so you have more choice of color by the end of the game.
