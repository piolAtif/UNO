 	<b>How to play:</b><br/>
 	<ul style="*">
 				<li>Deal 7 cards per player; create a Draw pile with remaining cards: Shuffle the deck and deal seven cards, face down, to each player. Stack the remaining cards face down to form a Draw pile.
				</li><br/>
 				<li>
 					Turn up first card in Draw pile: Turn over the first card in the Draw pile to create a Discard pile.

 				</li><br/>
 				<li>
 					 Have the person to your left match the Discard card: Have the person to the dealer’s left match some aspect of the Discard pile card — either the number, color, or symbol. Place this card face up on top of the Discard pile.

 				</li><br/>
 				<li>
 					Draw from the Draw pile if no match is made: Draw one card from the top of the Draw pile if no match can be made with the card on the Discard pile. The drawn card can be played if it matches the Discard pile card.

 				</li><br/>
 				<li>
 					Pass to next player: Pass the play to the next player after a match is made or a card is drawn from the Draw pile. Continue counterclockwise, matching the number, color, or symbol with the Discard pile or drawing from the Draw pile.

 				</li><br/>
 				<li>
 					Shout "Uno!" when you have one card left: Shout “Uno!” when you only have one card remaining in your hand. Play until one person is out of cards.

 				</li><br/>
 				<li>
 					 Add values of cards in opponents' hands for the score: Add the values of the cards remaining in everyone else’s hands, with number cards counting as face value; Draw Two, Reverse, and Skip cards counting for 20 points; and Wild Cards counting for 50 points.

 				</li><br/>
 				<li>
 					 Continue playing until someone's cards become empty.

	<b>Hints and tips:</b><br/>
	<ol>
		<li>
		 pay close attention because a lot of the time people aren't focusing on what they're doing.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Try to get rid of numbers that match up in your hand. For example if you have a red 5 and a yellow 5, try to get rid of one of the fives. It will help you have more number choices instead of repetatives.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Try to keep your wild card as long as you can! I have seen so many people use their wild card early on in the game and they just end up losing. It is a good idea to save it for the last card. For example if you have a wild card and a red 5 left, use your wild card and change the color to red, hoping that no one changes it by the time it comes back to you. I suggest if you have both a draw 4 wild card and a regular wild card, use the regular one first. You know that if you put down a draw 4 card, the player after you loses a turn and draws 4, so that's one step closer to making sure you get the color you need. The only time I suggest you use your wild card before last is if you are badly losing while everyone else is winning.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			 If the player before you puts down a wild card (a regular one) and they've only got one left, don't put a reverse card down, that's just giving that player an automatic win, and I've seen someone do that before. If that't the only card you have, draw a card or pass, so that the chances of them wining will be reduced because hopefully another player can change the color before they win.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Similar to the 4th, but if the player after you used a wild card and now only has one card left and the color hasn't been changed, try to change it by drawing a card hoping you can put a different color down with the same number or whatever. If you have no choice than just pass or play what you have. But at least you took the extra step by doing what you can to prevent them from winning.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			If you have a deck of the same color cards, or mostly the same color, play the ones that prevent the next player from having a turn first. For example if you have a deck of mostly yellow cards and maybe 3 are numbers, one is a skip card, one is a draw 2 card or whatever, play the skip or draw 2 cards first. You're increasing your chances of the color staying the same by the time it gets back to
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Don't forget to say Uno! So many people forget and it just causes you to draw 2 cards and reduces your chances of winning, so keep that in mind.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			I may have already said this but if you have both a draw 4 wild card and a regular wild card, use your regular one first because with your draw 4 one, you're taking a turn away from the next player, and may help increase your chances of the same color coming back to you. With the regular wild card you're changing the color but the next player may for example put down the color you chose and the one after may put down the same number but change the color. So automatically your plan is ruined.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			If you don't really have any good cards, but mostly just number cards of similar colors, just try to use the ones of similiar colors first so you have more choice of color by the end of the game.
		</li><br>

<div id="rules">
<h3>Rules:-</h3>

	<b>1) Normal Rules:-</b>
	<ol type = "a.">
		<li>The game continues until a player has one card left. The moment a player has just one card they must yell “UNO!”.If they are caught not saying “Uno” by another player before any card has been played, the player must draw two 	new cards. Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over, points are scored, and the game begins 	over again.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			After a card is drawn the player can discard it if it is a match, or if not, play passes on to the next player.

		</li><br>
		<li>
			The first player is normally the player to the left of the dealer and gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction. Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. For instance, if the     Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).

		</li><br>
		<li>
			If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, the game moves on to the next person in turn. You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.

		</li><br>
	</ol><br>

	<b>2) For Specials Cards:-</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Draw2Cards:-</b> When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up two cards and forfeit his/her turn.

		</li><br>
		<li>
			<b> WildDrawFour:-</b> This acts just like the wild card except that the next player also has to draw four cards. With this card, you must have no other alternative cards to play that matches the color of the card previously played. If you play this card illegally, you may be challenged by the other player to show your hand. If guilty, you need to draw 4 cards. If not, the challenger needs to draw 6 cards instead.

		</li><br>
		<li>
			<b>ReverseCard:-</b> If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			<b> WildCard:- </b>This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to state which 	color it will represent for the next player. It can be played regardless of whether another card is available.

		</li><br>
		<li>
			<b>SkipCard:-</b> When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. If turned up at the beginning, the first player loses his/her turn.
